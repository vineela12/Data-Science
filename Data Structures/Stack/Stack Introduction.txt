Stack:

1. LIFO Data Structure
2. Two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the last element that was added.
3. The push and pop operations occur only at one end of the structure, referred to as the top of the stack. 
4. A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity. 
5. If the stack is full and does not contain enough space to accept an entity to be pushed, the stack is then considered to be in an overflow state.
6. The pop operation removes an item from the top of the stack. 
7. A pop either reveals previously concealed items or results in an empty stack, but, if the stack is empty, it goes into underflow state, which means no items are present in stack to be removed.
8. A stack is a restricted data structure, because only a small number of operations are performed on it.

Static Implementation using Arrays : Fixed Memory Allocation
Dynamic Implementation using Linked Lists: Memory is allocated only after element is inserted to the stack.
